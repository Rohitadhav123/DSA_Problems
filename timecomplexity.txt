type of time complexity 
1.Big O   - Upper Bond  
2.Omega notation   - Average 
3.theta notation  - Lower Bound


Upper Bound : -

constant time :- O(1)   - means fixed time 

Linear time :- O(n)

Logarithmic time  :- O(logn)

Quadratic time :- O(n^2)

cubic time :- O(n^3)





Space Complexity :- how many memory require to program
